# tritonHacks Project
## by Breanna, Jessie, Jiya, and Sofia 
A website we created for the 2023 Tritonhack that solves problems with and helps regulate the circadian rhythms of astronauts to prevent health problems.

### Home Page

This page shows the astronaut the real time, along with a motivational quote to boost their mental health.

### Routine Page

After researching the circadian rhythm, its effect on the body and what happens when your circadian rhythm is offset or too short since astronauts experience sunrise and sunset in under 90 minutes due to constant orbiting, we created this agenda page for different times of day and what they must do at that time to maintain their circadian rhythm.
